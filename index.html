        <!-- <h1>What is Hack3D?</h1>
        <p>Hack3D is one of <a href="https://csaw.engineering.nyu.edu/hack3d">CSAW's</a> latest cybersecurity competition with an aim to raise awareness and generate discussion in engineering and research communities about security in the additive manufacturing (AM) field.
          <br>
          </p>
          Competitors will have the opportunity to learn and use skills in graphics programming, file manipulation, and reverse engineering while gaining an understanding of the additive manufacturing supply-chain.
          <p><a href="https://csaw.engineering.nyu.edu/hack3d/rules-guidelines">Take a look at the rules and guidelines</a></p>

          Students who are interested to learn more about CAD, reverse-engineering, security, and additive manufacturing are encouraged to apply.

          <h2> Problem Statement: </h2>
          <p>A hacktivist group on campus is looking around for new talent for an upcoming cyber-attack on Big3D, a 3D printer manufacturing company, and you are eager to join.</p>
          <p>The repaired .gcode could be any of the three chess pieces (pictured in the package). You should repair it to reconstruct only one of the pieces. While there are <i>no</i> wrong answers, there is a correct answer.</p>

          <p>Be sure to document all your attempts and thought processes in a report and submit it along with the attempted .gcode repair to csaw-3D@nyu.edu </p>
